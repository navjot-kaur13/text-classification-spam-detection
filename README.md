# Text Classification and Spam Detection

## Overview
This project performs **text classification** and **spam detection** using machine learning and NLP techniques.  
It can classify text messages as **spam** or **not spam**, and also perform **sentiment analysis** on textual data.  

## Features
- Spam detection using **Naive Bayes**, **Decision Tree**, and **KNN classifiers**  
- Text preprocessing including **tokenization**, **stop word removal**, and **vectorization**  
- Simple and easy-to-use Python scripts for experimentation  
- Can be extended for larger datasets and real-world applications  

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.x  
- Libraries: `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `nltk`  
- Jupyter Notebook for code experimentation and testing
  
## Project Purpose
The purpose of this project is to **detect spam messages** and **classify text** using machine learning techniques, helping to understand text preprocessing and basic NLP classifiers.
